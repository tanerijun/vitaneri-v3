In this post, we'll be solving "Add Two Numbers" from LeetCode.

The title sounds so simple but it's actually much more challenging then it sounds because we're dealing with linked list.

> A linked list is a sequence of nodes that contain two fields: an integer value and a link to the next node.

Now, let's go and solve the problem!

## Table Of Contents

## Problem

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Solution
