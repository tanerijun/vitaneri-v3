From a very young age, I've always been interested in Tech and Science. Initially, I started coding out of curiosity, eventually it became a hobby, and after many hobby projects, I finally decided to pursue a career in software development.

I have a passion for design and development, I like to create things that don't just look good, but also functional and performant. I am always eager to take on a challenge, and aim to excel in all the tasks I take on.

## About Vitaneri

I started Vitaneri as a personal blog in 2022, documenting stuff I learned in the tech world. Eventually, I decided to completely turn it into my personal site. So, Vitaneri is now a [blog](/posts/) focused on web development along with a porfolio of my [side projects](/projects/).

There is no ads or any sponsored content on Vitaneri. There is also no Google Analytics or any form of data collection because I respect your privacy :wink:.
