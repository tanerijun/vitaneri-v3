I write many [side projects](https://github.com/tanerijun) for learning or experiment purposes, though most of them are unfinished, unpresentable, private, or useless to anyone else but me üòÖ. That aside, here are some that I think are worth sharing:

## Vitaneri

This website! It's my first side project that I decide to commit for the long-term. That means this project will be a forever work in progress (I hope üòå).

Unlike my previous 2 portfolio websites. I decided to go minimalist on this one. Although the flashy animations and transitions from those websites are nice and eye candy, it's not really suitable for a blog, which is the main purpose of this site, a blog for documenting my discoveries in the tech world.

This time, I built the site using Astro with a sprinkle of React here and there. Everything is server-rendered, and the [comment system](https://giscus.app/) is also lazily loaded. The website is truly blazingly fast üí®.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the result, and I hope the site will be useful for someone out there.

Tech stacks:

- TypeScript
- Astro
- React
- Tailwind
- MDX

## Wordle Fever

Wordle Fever is a clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) for the true hardcore. You beat the game by guessing all the correct Wordles consecutively.

In other words, you win by accumulating 2315 win streaks.

You can rest assured that the same Wordle won't show up twice. The game will get easier the longer you play as the solution pool get smaller and smaller.

You have 6 tries to guess each Wordle. Type the Wordle with your Keyboard or Keypad, and press ENTER to submit.

Tech stacks:

- TypeScript
- React
- Framer Motion
- Chakra UI

I created Wordle Fever because I was addicted to Wordle. Wordle limit you to only 1 game each day, and that won't do for me. So I made Wordle to satisfy my hardcore Wordle need and added some hidden gimmicks to spice up the game üòè.
